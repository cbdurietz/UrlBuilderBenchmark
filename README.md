# UrlBuilderBenchmark

## Run benchmarks
Always run benchmarks in release mode. This could be done like this:

1. Open powershell and navigate to the solution folder.
2. Run `dotnet build -c Release`
3. Run the compiled application, probably something like `dotnet .\UrlBuilderBenchmark\bin\Release\net6.0\UrlBuilderBenchmark.dll`
4. Wait for the result.

## Run tests
There's also some tests included, using xUnit.
